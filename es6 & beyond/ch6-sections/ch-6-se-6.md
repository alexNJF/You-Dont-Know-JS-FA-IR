# Review

ES6 adds many extra API helpers on the various built-in native objects:

* `Array` adds `of(..)` and `from(..)` static functions, as well as prototype functions like `copyWithin(..)` and `fill(..)`.
* `Object` adds static functions like `is(..)` and `assign(..)`.
* `Math` adds static functions like `acosh(..)` and `clz32(..)`.
* `Number` adds static properties like `Number.EPSILON`, as well as static functions like `Number.isFinite(..)`.
* `String` adds static functions like `String.fromCodePoint(..)` and `String.raw(..)`, as well as prototype functions like `repeat(..)` and `includes(..)`.

Most of these additions can be polyfilled (see ES6 Shim), and were inspired by utilities in common JS libraries/frameworks.
