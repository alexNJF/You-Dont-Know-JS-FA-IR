# `for..of` Loops

Joining the `for` and `for..in` loops from the JavaScript we're all familiar with, ES6 adds a `for..of` loop, which loops over the set of values produced by an *iterator*.

The value you loop over with `for..of` must be an *iterable*, or it must be a value which can be coerced/boxed to an object (see the *Types & Grammar* title of this series) that is an iterable. An iterable is simply an object that is able to produce an iterator, which the loop then uses.

Let's compare `for..of` to `for..in` to illustrate the difference:

```js
var a = ["a","b","c","d","e"];

for (var idx in a) {
	console.log( idx );
}
// 0 1 2 3 4

for (var val of a) {
	console.log( val );
}
// "a" "b" "c" "d" "e"
```

As you can see, `for..in` loops over the keys/indexes in the `a` array, while `for..of` loops over the values in `a`.

Here's the pre-ES6 version of the `for..of` from that previous snippet:

```js
var a = ["a","b","c","d","e"],
	k = Object.keys( a );

for (var val, i = 0; i < k.length; i++) {
	val = a[ k[i] ];
	console.log( val );
}
// "a" "b" "c" "d" "e"
```

And here's the ES6 but non-`for..of` equivalent, which also gives a glimpse at manually iterating an iterator (see "Iterators" in Chapter 3):

```js
var a = ["a","b","c","d","e"];

for (var val, ret, it = a[Symbol.iterator]();
	(ret = it.next()) && !ret.done;
) {
	val = ret.value;
	console.log( val );
}
// "a" "b" "c" "d" "e"
```

Under the covers, the `for..of` loop asks the iterable for an iterator (using the built-in `Symbol.iterator`; see "Well-Known Symbols" in Chapter 7), then it repeatedly calls the iterator and assigns its produced value to the loop iteration variable.

Standard built-in values in JavaScript that are by default iterables (or provide them) include:

* Arrays
* Strings
* Generators (see Chapter 3)
* Collections / TypedArrays (see Chapter 5)

**Warning:** Plain objects are not by default suitable for `for..of` looping. That's because they don't have a default iterator, which is intentional, not a mistake. However, we won't go any further into those nuanced reasonings here. In "Iterators" in Chapter 3, we'll see how to define iterators for our own objects, which lets `for..of` loop over any object to get a set of values we define.

Here's how to loop over the characters in a primitive string:

```js
for (var c of "hello") {
	console.log( c );
}
// "h" "e" "l" "l" "o"
```

The `"hello"` primitive string value is coerced/boxed to the `String` object wrapper equivalent, which is an iterable by default.

In `for (XYZ of ABC)..`, the `XYZ` clause can either be an assignment expression or a declaration, identical to that same clause in `for` and `for..in` loops. So you can do stuff like this:

```js
var o = {};

for (o.a of [1,2,3]) {
	console.log( o.a );
}
// 1 2 3

for ({x: o.a} of [ {x: 1}, {x: 2}, {x: 3} ]) {
  console.log( o.a );
}
// 1 2 3
```

`for..of` loops can be prematurely stopped, just like other loops, with `break`, `continue`, `return` (if in a function), and thrown exceptions. In any of these cases, the iterator's `return(..)` function is automatically called (if one exists) to let the iterator perform cleanup tasks, if necessary.

**Note:** See "Iterators" in Chapter 3 for more complete coverage on iterables and iterators.
