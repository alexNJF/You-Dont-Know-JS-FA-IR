# Number Literal Extensions

Prior to ES5, number literals looked like the following -- the octal form was not officially specified, only allowed as an extension that browsers had come to de facto agreement on:

```js
var dec = 42,
	oct = 052,
	hex = 0x2a;
```

**Note:** Though you are specifying a number in different bases, the number's mathematic value is what is stored, and the default output interpretation is always base-10. The three variables in the previous snippet all have the `42` value stored in them.

To further illustrate that `052` was a nonstandard form extension, consider:

```js
Number( "42" );				// 42
Number( "052" );			// 52
Number( "0x2a" );			// 42
```

ES5 continued to permit the browser-extended octal form (including such inconsistencies), except that in strict mode, the octal literal (`052`) form is disallowed. This restriction was done mainly because many developers had the habit (from other languages) of seemingly innocuously prefixing otherwise base-10 numbers with `0`'s for code alignment purposes, and then running into the accidental fact that they'd changed the number value entirely!

ES6 continues the legacy of changes/variations to how number literals outside base-10 numbers can be represented. There's now an official octal form, an amended hexadecimal form, and a brand-new binary form. For web compatibility reasons, the old octal `052` form will continue to be legal (though unspecified) in non-strict mode, but should really never be used anymore.

Here are the new ES6 number literal forms:

```js
var dec = 42,
	oct = 0o52,			// or `0O52` :(
	hex = 0x2a,			// or `0X2a` :/
	bin = 0b101010;		// or `0B101010` :/
```

The only decimal form allowed is base-10. Octal, hexadecimal, and binary are all integer forms.

And the string representations of these forms are all able to be coerced/converted to their number equivalent:

```js
Number( "42" );			// 42
Number( "0o52" );		// 42
Number( "0x2a" );		// 42
Number( "0b101010" );	// 42
```

Though not strictly new to ES6, it's a little-known fact that you can actually go the opposite direction of conversion (well, sort of):

```js
var a = 42;

a.toString();			// "42" -- also `a.toString( 10 )`
a.toString( 8 );		// "52"
a.toString( 16 );		// "2a"
a.toString( 2 );		// "101010"
```

In fact, you can represent a number this way in any base from `2` to `36`, though it'd be rare that you'd go outside the standard bases: 2, 8, 10, and 16.
