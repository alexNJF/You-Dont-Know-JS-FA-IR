# This Is It!

OK, enough of the wordy lecture. You're ready to dive into `this` code, right?

Let's revisit (and extend) `Point2d` from Chapter 3, but just as an object with data properties and functions on it, instead of using `class`:

```js
var point = {
    x: null,
    y: null,

    init(x,y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    },
    rotate(angleRadians) {
        var rotatedX = this.x * Math.cos(angleRadians) -
            this.y * Math.sin(angleRadians);
        var rotatedY = this.x * Math.sin(angleRadians) +
            this.y * Math.cos(angleRadians);
        this.x = rotatedX;
        this.y = rotatedY;
    },
    toString() {
        return `(${this.x},${this.y})`;
    },
};
```

As you can see, the `init(..)`, `rotate(..)`, and `toString()` functions are `this`-aware. You might be in the habit of assuming that the `this` reference will obviously always hold the `point` object. But that's not guaranteed in any way.

Keep reminding yourself as you go through the rest of this chapter: the `this` value for a function is determined by *how* the function is invoked. That means you can't look at the function's definition, nor where the function is defined (not even the enclosing `class`!). In fact, it doesn't even matter where the function is called from.

We only need to look at *how* the functions are called; that's the only factor that matters.

### Implicit Context Invocation

Consider this call:

```js
point.init(3,4);
```

We're invoking the `init(..)` function, but notice the `point.` in front of it? This is an *implicit context* binding. It says to JS: invoke the `init(..)` function with `this` referencing `point`.

That is the *normal* way we'd expect a `this` to work, and that's also one of the most common ways we invoke functions. So the typical invocation gives us the intuitive outcome. That's a good thing!

### Default Context Invocation

But what happens if we do this?

```js
const init = point.init;
init(3,4);
```

You might assume that we'd get the same outcome as the previous snippet. But that's not how JS `this` assignment works.

The *call-site* for the function is `init(3,4)`, which is different than `point.init(3,4)`. When there's no *implicit context* (`point.`), nor any other kind of `this` assignment mechanism, the *default context* assignment occurs.

What will `this` reference when `init(3,4)` is invoked like that?

*It depends.*

Uh oh. Depends? That sounds confusing.

Don't worry, it's not as bad as it sounds. The *default context* assignment depends on whether the code is in strict-mode or not. But thankfully, virtually all JS code these days is running in strict-mode; for example, ESM (ES Modules) always run in strict-mode, as does code inside a `class` block. And virtually all transpiled JS code (via Babel, TypeScript, etc) is written to declare strict-mode.

So almost all of the time, modern JS code will be running in strict-mode, and thus the *default assignment* context won't "depend" on anything; it's pretty straightforward: `undefined`. That's it!

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Keep in mind: `undefined` does not mean "not defined"; it means, "defined with the special empty `undefined` value". I know, I know... the name and meaning are mismatched. That's language legacy baggage, for you. (shrugging shoulders) |

That means `init(3,4)`, if run in strict-mode, would throw an exception. Why? Because the `this.x` reference in `init(..)` is a `.x` property access on `undefined` (i.e., `undefined.x`), which is not allowed:

```js
"use strict";

var point = { /* .. */ };

const init = point.init;
init(3,4);
// TypeError: Cannot set properties of
// undefined (setting 'x')
```

Stop for a moment and consider: why would JS choose to default the context to `undefined`, so that any *default context* invocation of a `this`-aware function will fail with such an exception?

Because a `this`-aware function **always needs a `this`**. The invocation `init(3,4)` isn't providing a `this`, so that *is* a mistake, and *should* raise an exception so the mistake can be corrected. The lesson: never invoke a `this`-aware function without providing it a `this`!

Just for completeness sake: in the less common non-strict mode, the *default context* is the global object -- JS defines it as `globalThis`, which in browser JS is essentially an alias to `window`, and in Node it's `global`. So, when `init(3,4)` runs in non-strict mode, the `this.x` expression is `globalThis.x` -- also known as `window.x` in the browser, or `global.x` in Node. Thus, `globalThis.x` gets set as `3` and `globalThis.y` gets set as `4`.

```js
// no strict-mode here, beware!

var point = { /* .. */ };

const init = point.init;
init(3,4);

globalThis.x;   // 3
globalThis.y;   // 4
point.x;        // null
point.y;        // null
```

That's unfortunate, because it's almost certainly *not* the intended outcome. Not only is it bad if it's a global variable, but it's also *not* changing the property on our `point` object, so program bugs are guaranteed.

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| Ouch! Nobody wants accidental global variables implicitly created from all over the code. The lesson: always make sure your code is running in strict-mode! |

### Explicit Context Invocation

Functions can alternately be invoked with *explicit context*, using the built-in `call(..)` or `apply(..)` utilities:

```js
var point = { /* .. */ };

const init = point.init;

init.call( point, 3, 4 );
// or: init.apply( point, [ 3, 4 ] )

point.x;        // 3
point.y;        // 4
```

`init.call(point,3,4)` is effectively the same as `point.init(3,4)`, in that both of them assign `point` as the `this` context for the `init(..)` invocation.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Both `call(..)` and `apply(..)` utilities take as their first argument a `this` context value; that's almost always an object, but can technically can be any value (number, string, etc). The `call(..)` utility takes subsequent arguments and passes them through to the invoked function, whereas `apply(..)` expects its second argument to be an array of values to pass as arguments. |

It might seem awkward to contemplate invoking a function with the *explicit context* assignment (`call(..)` / `apply(..)`) style in your program. But it's more useful than might be obvious at first glance.

Let's recall the original snippet:

```js
var point = {
    x: null,
    y: null,

    init(x,y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    },
    rotate(angleRadians) { /* .. */ },
    toString() {
        return `(${this.x},${this.y})`;
    },
};

point.init(3,4);

var anotherPoint = {};
point.init.call( anotherPoint, 5, 6 );

point.x;                // 3
point.y;                // 4
anotherPoint.x;         // 5
anotherPoint.y;         // 6
```

Are you seeing what I did there?

I wanted to define `anotherPoint`, but I didn't want to repeat the definitions of those `init(..)` / `rotate(..)` / `toString()` functions from `point`. So I "borrowed" a function reference, `point.init`, and explicitly set the empty object `anotherPoint` as the `this` context, via `call(..)`.

When `init(..)` is running at that moment, `this` inside it will reference `anotherPoint`, and that's why the `x` / `y` properties (values `5` / `6`, respectively) get set there.

Any `this`-aware functions can be borrowed like this: `point.rotate.call(anotherPoint, ..)`, `point.toString.call(anotherPoint)`.

#### Revisiting Implicit Context Invocation

Another approach to share behavior between `point` and `anotherPoint` would have been:

```js
var point = { /* .. */ };

var anotherPoint = {
    init: point.init,
    rotate: point.rotate,
    toString: point.toString,
};

anotherPoint.init(5,6);

anotherPoint.x;         // 5
anotherPoint.y;         // 6
```

This is another way of "borrowing" the functions, by adding shared references to the functions on any target object (e.g., `anotherPoint`). The call-site invocation `anotherPoint.init(5,6)` is the more natural/ergonomic style that relies on *implicit context* assignment.

It may seem this approach is a little cleaner, comparing `anotherPoint.init(5,6)` to `point.init.call(anotherPoint,5,6)`.

But the main downside is having to modify any target object with such shared function references, which can be verbose, manual, and error-prone. Sometimes such an approach is acceptable, but many other times, *explicit context* assignment with `call(..)` / `apply(..)` is more preferable.

### New Context Invocation

We've so far seen three different ways of context assignment at the function call-site: *default*, *implicit*, and *explicit*.

A fourth way to call a function, and assign the `this` for that invocation, is with the `new` keyword:

```js
var point = {
    // ..

    init: function() { /* .. */ }

    // ..
};

var anotherPoint = new point.init(3,4);

anotherPoint.x;     // 3
anotherPoint.y;     // 4
```

| TIP: |
| :--- |
| This example has a bit of nuance to be explained. The `init: function() { .. }` form shown here -- specifically, a function expression assigned to a property -- is required for the function to be validly called with the `new` keyword. From previous snippets, the concise method form of `init() { .. }` defines a function that *cannot* be called with `new`. |

You've typically seen `new` used with `class` for creating instances. But as an underlying mechanism of the JS language, `new` is not inherently a `class` operation.

In a sense, the `new` keyword hijacks a function and forces its behavior into a different mode than a normal invocation. Here are the 4 special steps that JS performs when a function is invoked with `new`:

1. create a brand new empty object, out of thin air.

2. link the `[[Prototype]]` of that new empty object to the function's `.prototype` object (see Chapter 2).

3. invoke the function with the `this` context set to that new empty object.

4. if the function doesn't return its own object value explicitly (with a `return ..` statement), assume the function call should instead return the new object (from steps 1-3).

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| Step 4 implies that if you `new` invoke a function that *does* return its own object -- like `return { .. }`, etc -- then the new object from steps 1-3 is *not* returned. That's a tricky gotcha to be aware of, in that it effectively discards that new object before the program has a chance to receive and store a reference to it. Essentially, `new` should never be used to invoke a function that has explicit `return ..` statement(s) in it. |

To understand these 4 `new` steps more concretely, I'm going to illustrate them in code, as an alternate to using the `new` keyword:

```js
// alternative to:
//   var anotherPoint = new point.init(3,4)

var anotherPoint;
// this is a bare block to hide local
// `let` declarations
{
    // (Step 1)
    let tmpObj = {};

    // (Step 2)
    Object.setPrototypeOf(
        tmpObj, point.init.prototype
    );
    // or: tmpObj.__proto__ = point.init.prototype

    // (Step 3)
    let res = point.init.call(tmpObj,3,4);

    // (Step 4)
    anotherPoint = (
        typeof res !== "object" ? tmpObj : res
    );
}
```

Clearly, the `new` invocation streamlines that set of manual steps!

| TIP: |
| :--- |
| The `Object.setPrototypeOf(..)` in step 2 could also have been done via the `__proto__` property, such as `tmpObj.__proto__ = point.init.prototype`, or even as part of the object literal (step 1) with `tmpObj = { __proto__: point.init.prototype }`. |

Skipping some of the formality of these steps, let's recall an earlier snippet and see how `new` approximates a similar outcome:

```js
var point = { /* .. */ };

// this approach:
var anotherPoint = {};
point.init.call(anotherPoint,5,6);

// can instead be approximated as:
var yetAnotherPoint = new point.init(5,6);
```

That's a bit nicer! But there's a caveat here.

Using the other functions that `point` holds against `anotherPoint` / `yetAnotherPoint`, we won't want to do with `new`. Why? Because `new` is creating a *new* object, but that's not what we want if we intend to invoke a function against an existing object.

Instead, we'll likely use *explicit context* assignment:

```js
point.rotate.call( anotherPoint, /*angleRadians=*/Math.PI );

point.toString.call( yetAnotherPoint );
// (5,6)
```

### Review This

We've seen four rules for `this` context assignment in function calls. Let's put them in order of precedence:

1. Is the function invoked with `new`, creating and setting a *new* `this`?

2. Is the function invoked with `call(..)` or `apply(..)`, *explicitly* setting `this`?

3. Is the function invoked with an object reference at the call-site (e.g., `point.init(..)`), *implicitly* setting `this`?

4. If none of the above... are we in non-strict mode? If so, *default* the `this` to `globalThis`. But if in strict-mode, *default* the `this` to `undefined`.

These rules, *in this order*, are how JS determines the `this` for a function invocation. If multiple rules match a call-site (e.g., `new point.init.call(..)`), the first rule from the list to match wins.

That's it, you're now master over the `this` keyword. Well, not quite. There's a bunch more nuance to cover. But you're well on your way!
