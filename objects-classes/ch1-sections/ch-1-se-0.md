> Everything in JS is an object.

This is one of the most pervasive, but most incorrect, "facts" that perpetually circulates about JS. Let the myth busting commence.

JS definitely has objects, but that doesn't mean that all values are objects. Nevertheless, objects are arguably the most important (and varied!) value type in the language, so mastering them is critical to your JS journey.

The object mechanism is certainly the most flexible and powerful container type -- something you put other values into; every JS program you write will use them in one way or another. But that's not why objects deserve top billing for this book. Objects are the foundation for the second of JS's three pillars: the prototype.

Why are prototypes (along with the `this` keyword, covered later in the book) so core to JS as to be one of its three pillars? Among other things, prototypes are how JS's object system can express the class design pattern, one of the most widely relied on design patterns in all of programming.

So our journey here will start with objects, build up a compelete understanding of prototypes, de-mystify the `this` keyword, and explore the `class` system.
