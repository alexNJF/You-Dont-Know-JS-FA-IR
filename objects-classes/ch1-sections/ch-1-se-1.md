# About This Book

Welcome to book 3 in the *You Don't Know JS Yet* series! If you already finished *Get Started* (the first book) and *Scope & Closures* (the second book), you're in the right spot! If not, before you proceed I encourage you to read those two as foundations before diving into this book.

The first edition of this book is titled, "this & Object Prototypes". In that book, our focus started with the `this` keyword, as it's arguably one of the most confused topics in all of JS. The book then spent the majority of its time focused on expositing the prototype system and advocating for embrace of the lesser-known "delegation" pattern instead of class designs. At the time of that book's writing (2014), ES6 would still be almost 2 years to its completion, so I felt the early sketches of the `class` keyword only merited a brief addendum of coverage.

It's quite an understatement to say a lot has changed in the JS landscape in the almost 8 years since that book. ES6 is old news now; at the time of *this* book's writing, JS has seen 7 yearly updates **after ES6** (ES2016 through ES2022).

Now, we still need to talk about how `this` works, and how that relates to methods invoked against various objects. And `class` actually operates (mostly!) via the prototype chain deep under the covers. But JS developers in 2022 are almost never writing code to explicitly wire up prototypal inheritance anymore. And as much as I personally wish differently, class design patterns -- not "behavior delegation" -- are how the majority of data and behavior organization (data structures) in JS are expressed.

This book reflects JS's current reality: thus the new sub-title, new organization and focus of topics, and complete re-write of the previous edition's text.
