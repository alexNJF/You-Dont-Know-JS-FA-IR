# Class Extension

The way to unlock the power of class inheritance is through the `extends` keyword, which defines a relationship between two classes:

```js
class Point2d {
    x = 3
    y = 4

    getX() {
        return this.x;
    }
}

class Point3d extends Point2d {
    x = 21
    y = 10
    z = 5

    printDoubleX() {
        console.log(`double x: ${this.getX() * 2}`);
    }
}

var point = new Point2d();

point.getX();                   // 3

var anotherPoint = new Point3d();

anotherPoint.getX();            // 21
anotherPoint.printDoubleX();    // double x: 42
```

Take a few moments to re-read that code snippet and make sure you fully understand what's happening.

The base class `Point2d` defines fields (members) called `x` and `y`, and gives them the initial values `3` and `4`, respectively. It also defines a `getX()` method that accesses this `x` instance member and returns it. We see that behavior illustrated in the `point.getX()` method call.

But the `Point3d` class extends `Point2d`, making `Point3d` a derived-class, child-class, or (most commonly) subclass. In `Point3d`, the same `x` property that's inherited from `Point2d` is re-initialized with a different `21` value, as is the `y` overridden to value from `4`, to `10`.

It also adds a new `z` field/member method, as well as a `printDoubleX()` method, which itself calls `this.getX()`.

When `anotherPoint.printDoubleX()` is invoked, the inherited `this.getX()` is thus invoked, and that method makes reference to `this.x`. Since `this` is pointing at the class instance (aka, `anotherPoint`), the value it finds is now `21` (instead of `3` from the `point` object's `x` member).

### Extending Expressions

// TODO: cover `class Foo extends ..` where `..` is an expression, not a class-name

### Overriding Methods

In addition to overriding a field/member in a subclass, you can also override (redefine) a method:

```js
class Point2d {
    x = 3
    y = 4

    getX() {
        return this.x;
    }
}

class Point3d extends Point2d {
    x = 21
    y = 10
    z = 5

    getX() {
        return this.x * 2;
    }
    printX() {
        console.log(`double x: ${this.getX()}`);
    }
}

var point = new Point3d();

point.printX();       // double x: 42
```

The `Point3d` subclass overrides the inherited `getX()` method to give it different behavior. However, you can still instantiate the base `Point2d` class, which would then give an object that uses the original (`return this.x;`) definition for `getX()`.

If you want to access an inherited method from a subclass even if it's been overridden, you can use `super` instead of `this`:

```js
class Point2d {
    x = 3
    y = 4

    getX() {
        return this.x;
    }
}

class Point3d extends Point2d {
    x = 21
    y = 10
    z = 5

    getX() {
        return this.x * 2;
    }
    printX() {
        console.log(`x: ${super.getX()}`);
    }
}

var point = new Point3d();

point.printX();       // x: 21
```

The ability for methods of the same name, at different levels of the inheritance hierarchy, to exhibit different behavior when either accessed directly, or relatively with `super`, is called *method polymorphism*. It's a very powerful part of class-orientation, when used appropriately.

### That's Super!

In addition to a subclass method accessing an inherited method definition (even if overriden on the subclass) via `super.` reference, a subclass constructor must manually invoke the inherited base class constructor via `super(..)` function invocation:

```js
class Point2d {
    x
    y
    constructor(x,y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

class Point3d extends Point2d {
    z
    constructor(x,y,z) {
        super(x,y);
        this.z = z;
    }
    toString() {
        console.log(`(${this.x},${this.y},${this.z})`);
    }
}

var point = new Point3d(3,4,5);

point.toString();       // (3,4,5)
```

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| An explicitly defined subclass constructor *must* call `super(..)` to run the inherited class's initialization, and that must occur before the subclass constructor makes any references to `this` or finishes/returns. Otherwise, a runtime exception will be thrown when that subclass constructor is invoked (via `new`). If you omit the subclass constructor, the default constructor automatically -- thankfully! -- invokes `super()` for you. |

One nuance to be aware of: if you define a field (public or private) inside a subclass, and explicitly define a `constructor(..)` for this subclass, the field initializations will be processed not at the top of the constructor, but *between* the `super(..)` call and any subsequent code in the constructor.

Pay close attention to the order of console messages here:

```js
class Point2d {
    x
    y
    constructor(x,y) {
        console.log("Running Point2d(..) constructor");
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

class Point3d extends Point2d {
    z = console.log("Initializing field 'z'")

    constructor(x,y,z) {
        console.log("Running Point3d(..) constructor");
        super(x,y);

        console.log(`Setting instance property 'z' to ${z}`);
        this.z = z;
    }
    toString() {
        console.log(`(${this.x},${this.y},${this.z})`);
    }
}

var point = new Point3d(3,4,5);
// Running Point3d(..) constructor
// Running Point2d(..) constructor
// Initializing field 'z'
// Setting instance property 'z' to 5
```

As the console messages illustrate, the `z = ..` field initialization happens *immediately after* the `super(x,y)` call, *before* the ``console.log(`Setting instance...`)`` is executed. Perhaps think of it like the field initializations attached to the end of the `super(..)` call, so they run before anything else in the constructor does.

#### Which Class?

You may need to determine in a constructor if that class is being instantiated directly, or being instantiated from a subclass with a `super()` call. We can use a special "pseudo property" `new.target`:

```js
class Point2d {
    // ..

    constructor(x,y) {
        if (new.target === Point2d) {
            console.log("Constructing 'Point2d' instance");
        }
    }

    // ..
}

class Point3d extends Point2d {
    // ..

    constructor(x,y,z) {
        super(x,y);

        if (new.target === Point3d) {
            console.log("Constructing 'Point3d' instance");
        }
    }

    // ..
}

var point = new Point2d(3,4);
// Constructing 'Point2d' instance

var anotherPoint = new Point3d(3,4,5);
// Constructing 'Point3d' instance
```

### But Which Kind Of Instance?

You may want to introspect a certain object instance to see if it's an instance of a specific class. We do this with the `instanceof` operator:

```js
class Point2d { /* .. */ }
class Point3d extends Point2d { /* .. */ }

var point = new Point2d(3,4);

point instanceof Point2d;           // true
point instanceof Point3d;           // false

var anotherPoint = new Point3d(3,4,5);

anotherPoint instanceof Point2d;    // true
anotherPoint instanceof Point3d;    // true
```

It may seem strange to see `anotherPoint instanceof Point2d` result in `true`. To understand why better, perhaps it's useful to visualize both `[[Prototype]]` chains:

```
Point2d.prototype
        /       \
       /         \
      /           \
  point   Point3d.prototype
                    \
                     \
                      \
                    anotherPoint
```

The `instanceof` operator doesn't just look at the current object, but rather traverses the entire class inheritance hierarchy (the `[[Prototype]]` chain) until it finds a match. Thus, `anotherPoint` is an instance of both `Point3d` and `Point2d`.

To illustrate this fact a little more obviously, another (less ergonomic) way of going about the same kind of check as `instanceof` is with the (inherited from `Object.prototype`) utility, `isPrototypeOf(..)`:

```js
Point2d.prototype.isPrototypeOf(point);             // true
Point3d.prototype.isPrototypeOf(point);             // false

Point2d.prototype.isPrototypeOf(anotherPoint);      // true
Point3d.prototype.isPrototypeOf(anotherPoint);      // true
```

This utility makes it a little clearer why both `Point2d.prototype.isPrototypeOf(anotherPoint)` and `anotherPoint instanceof Point2d` result in `true`: the object `Point2d.prototype` *is* in the `[[Prototype]]` chain of `anotherPoint`.

If you instead wanted to check if the object instance was *only and directly* created by a certain class, check the instance's `constructor` property.

```js
point.constructor === Point2d;          // true
point.constructor === Point3d;          // false

anotherPoint.constructor === Point2d;   // false
anotherPoint.constructor === Point3d;   // true
```

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| The `constructor` property shown here is *not* actually present on (owned) the `point` or `anotherPoint` instance objects. So where does it come from!? It's on each object's `[[Prototype]]` linked prototype object: `Point2d.prototype.constructor === Point2d` and `Point3d.prototype.constructor === Point3d`. |

### "Inheritance" Is Sharing, Not Copying

It may seem as if `Point3d`, when it `extends` the `Point2d` class, is in essence getting a *copy* of all the behavior defined in `Point2d`. Moreover, it may seem as if the concrete object instance `anotherPoint` receives, *copied down* to it, all the methods from `Point3d` (and by extension, also from `Point2d`).

However, that's not the correct mental model to use for JS's implementation of class-orientation. Recall this base class and subclass definition, as well as instantiation of `anotherPoint`:

```js
class Point2d {
    x
    y
    constructor(x,y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

class Point3d extends Point2d {
    z
    constructor(x,y,z) {
        super(x,y);
        this.z = z;
    }
    toString() {
        console.log(`(${this.x},${this.y},${this.z})`);
    }
}

var anotherPoint = new Point3d(3,4,5);
```

If you inspect the `anotherPoint` object, you'll see it only has the `x`, `y`, and `z` properties (instance members) on it, but not the `toString()` method:

```js
Object.hasOwn(anotherPoint,"x");                       // true
Object.hasOwn(anotherPoint,"y");                       // true
Object.hasOwn(anotherPoint,"z");                       // true

Object.hasOwn(anotherPoint,"toString");                // false
```

Where is that `toString()` method located? On the prototype object:

```js
Object.hasOwn(Point3d.prototype,"toString");    // true
```

And `anotherPoint` has access to that method via its `[[Prototype]]` linkage (see Chapter 2). In other words, the prototype objects **share access** to their method(s) with the subclass(es) and instance(s). The method(s) stay in place, and are not copied down the inheritance chain.

As nice as the `class` syntax is, don't forget what's really happening under the syntax: JS is *just* wiring up objects to each other along a `[[Prototype]]` chain.
