# `[[Prototype]]` Chain

One of the most important, but least obvious, characteristics of an object (part of the MOP) is referred to as its "prototype chain"; the official JS specification notation is `[[Prototype]]`. Make sure not to confuse this `[[Prototype]]` with a public property named `prototype`. Despite the naming, these are distinct concepts.

The `[[Prototype]]` is an internal linkage that an object gets by default when its created, pointing to another object. This linkage is a hidden, often subtle characteristic of an object, but it has profound impacts on how interactions with the object will play out. It's referred to as a "chain" because one object links to another, which in turn links to another, ... and so on. There is an *end* or *top* to this chain, where the linkage stops and there's no further to go. More on that shortly.

We already saw several implications of `[[Prototype]]` linkage in Chapter 1. For example, by default, all objects are `[[Prototype]]`-linked to the built-in object named `Object.prototype`.

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| That `Object.prototype` name itself can be confusing, since it uses a property called `prototype`. How are `[[Prototype]]` and `prototype` related!? Put such questions/confusion on pause for a bit, as we'll come back an explain the differences between `[[Prototype]]` and `prototype` later in this chapter. For the moment, just assume the presence of this important but weirdly named built-in object, `Object.prototype`. |

Let's consider some code:

```js
myObj = {
    favoriteNumber: 42
};
```

That should look familiar from Chapter 1. But what you *don't see* in this code is that the object there was automatically linked (via its internal `[[Prototype]]`) to that automatically built-in, but weirdly named, `Object.prototype` object.

When we do things like:

```js
myObj.toString();                             // "[object Object]"

myObj.hasOwnProperty("favoriteNumber");   // true
```

We're taking advantage of this internal `[[Prototype]]` linkage, without really realizing it. Since `myObj` does not have `toString` or `hasOwnProperty` properties defined on it, those property accesses actually end up **DELEGATING** the access to continue its lookup along the `[[Prototype]]` chain.

Since `myObj` is `[[Prototype]]`-linked to the object named `Object.prototype`, the lookup for `toString` and `hasOwnProperty` properties continues on that object; and indeed, these methods are found there!

The ability for `myObj.toString` to access the `toString` property even though it doesn't actually have it, is commonly referred to as "inheritance", or more specifically, "prototypal inheritance". The `toString` and `hasOwnProperty` properties, along with many others, are said to be "inherited properties" on `myObj`.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| I have a lot of frustrations with the usage of the word "inheritance" here -- it should be called "delegation"! --  but that's what most people refer to it as, so we'll begrudgingly comply and use that same terminology for now (albeit under protest, with " quotes). I'll save my objections for an appendix of this book. |

`Object.prototype` has several built-in properties and methods, all of which are "inherited" by any object that is `[[Prototype]]`-linked, either directly or indirectly through another object's linkage, to `Object.prototype`.

Some common "inherited" properties from `Object.prototype` include:

* `constructor`
* `__proto__`
* `toString()`
* `valueOf()`
* `hasOwnProperty(..)`
* `isPrototypeOf(..)`

Recall `hasOwnProperty(..)`, which we saw earlier gives us a boolean check for whether a certain property (by string name) is owned by an object:

```js
myObj = {
    favoriteNumber: 42
};

myObj.hasOwnProperty("favoriteNumber");   // true
```

It's always been considered somewhat unfortunate (semantic organization, naming conflicts, etc) that such an important utility as `hasOwnProperty(..)` was included on the Object `[[Prototype]]` chain as an instance method, instead of being defined as a static utility.

As of ES2022, JS has finally added the static version of this utility: `Object.hasOwn(..)`.

```js
myObj = {
    favoriteNumber: 42
};

Object.hasOwn(myObj,"favoriteNumber");   // true
```

This form is now considered the more preferable and robust option, and the instance method (`hasOwnProperty(..)`) form should now generally be avoided.

Somewhat unfortunately and inconsistently, there's not (yet, as of time of writing) corresponding static utilities, like `Object.isPrototype(..)` (instead of the instance method `isPrototypeOf(..)`). But at least `Object.hasOwn(..)` exists, so that's progress.

### Creating An Object With A Different `[[Prototype]]`

By default, any object you create in your programs will be `[[Prototype]]`-linked to that `Object.prototype` object. However, you can create an object with a different linkage like this:

```js
myObj = Object.create(differentObj);
```

The `Object.create(..)` method takes its first argument as the value to set for the newly created object's `[[Prototype]]`.

One downside to this approach is that you aren't using the `{ .. }` literal syntax, so you don't initially define any contents for `myObj`. You typically then have to define properties one-by-one, using `=`.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| The second, optional argument to `Object.create(..)` is -- like the second argument to `Object.defineProperties(..)` as discussed earlier -- an object with properties that hold descriptors to initially define the new object with. In practice out in the wild, this form is rarely used, likely because it's more awkward to specify full descriptors instead of just name/value pairs. But it may come in handy in some limited cases. |

Alternately, but less preferably, you can use the `{ .. }` literal syntax along with a special (and strange looking!) property:

```js
myObj = {
    __proto__: differentObj,

    // .. the rest of the object definition
};
```

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| The strange looking `__proto__` property has been in some JS engines for more than 20 years, but was only standardized in JS as of ES6 (in 2015). Even still, it was added in Appendix B of the specification[^specApB], which lists features that TC39 begrudgingly includes because they exist popularly in various browser-based JS engines and therefore are a de-facto reality even if they didn't originate with TC39. This feature is thus "guaranteed" by the spec to exist in all conforming browser-based JS engines, but is not necessarily guaranteed to work in other independent JS engines. Node.js uses the JS engine (v8) from the Chrome browser, so Node.js gets `__proto__` by default/accident. Be careful when using `__proto__` to be aware of all the JS engine environments your code will run in. |

Whether you use `Object.create(..)` or `__proto__`, the created object in question will usually be `[[Prototype]]`-linked to a different object than the default `Object.prototype`.

#### Empty `[[Prototype]]` Linkage

We mentioned above that the `[[Prototype]]` chain has to stop somewhere, so as to have lookups not continue forever. `Object.prototype` is typically the top/end of every `[[Prototype]]` chain, as its own `[[Prototype]]` is `null`, and therefore there's nowhere else to continue looking.

However, you can also define objects with their own `null` value for `[[Prototype]]`, such as:

```js
emptyObj = Object.create(null);
// or: emptyObj = { __proto__: null }

emptyObj.toString;   // undefined
```

It can be quite useful to create an object with no `[[Prototype]]` linkage to `Object.prototype`. For example, as mentioned in Chapter 1, the `in` and `for..in` constructs will consult the `[[Prototype]]` chain for inherited properties. But this may be undesirable, as you may not want something like `"toString" in myObj` to resolve successfully.

Moreover, an object with an empty `[[Prototype]]` is safe from any accidental "inheritance" collision between its own property names and the ones it "inherits" from elsewhere. These types of (useful!) objects are sometimes referred to in popular parlance as "dictionary objects".

### `[[Prototype]]` vs `prototype`

Notice that public property name `prototype` in the name/location of this special object, `Object.prototype`? What's that all about?

`Object` is the `Object(..)` function; by default, all functions (which are themselves objects!) have such a `prototype` property on them, pointing at an object.

Any here's where the name conflict between `[[Prototype]]` and `prototype` really bites us. The `prototype` property on a function doesn't define any linkage that the function itself experiences. Indeed, functions (as objects) have their own internal `[[Prototype]]` linkage somewhere else -- more on that in a second.

Rather, the `prototype` property on a function refers to an object that should be *linked TO* by any other object that is created when calling that function with the `new` keyword:

```js
myObj = {};

// is basically the same as:
myObj = new Object();
```

Since the `{ .. }` object literal syntax is essentially the same as a `new Object()` call, the built-in object named/located at `Object.prototype` is used as the internal `[[Prototype]]` value for the new object we create and name `myObj`.

Phew! Talk about a topic made significantly more confusing just because of the name overlap between `[[Prototype]]` and `prototype`!

----

But where do functions themselves (as objects!) link to, `[[Prototype]]` wise? They link to `Function.prototype`, yet another built-in object, located at the `prototype` property on the `Function(..)` function.

In other words, you can think of functions themselves as having been "created" by a `new Function(..)` call, and then `[[Prototype]]`-linked to the `Function.prototype` object. This object contains properties/methods all functions "inherit" by default, such as `toString()` (to string serialize the source code of a function) and `call(..)` / `apply(..)` / `bind(..)` (we'll explain these later in this book).
