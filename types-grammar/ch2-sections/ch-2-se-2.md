## Primitive Assignments

Any assignment of a primitive value from one variable/container to another is a *value-copy*:

```js
myAge = 42;

yourAge = myAge;        // assigned by value-copy

myAge;                  // 42
yourAge;                // 42
```

Here, the `myAge` and `yourAge` variables each have their own copy of the number value `42`.

| NOTE: |
| :--- |
| Inside the JS engine, it *may* be the case that only one `42` value exists in memory, and the engine points both `myAge` and `yourAge` variables at the shared value. Since primitive values are immutable, there's no danger in a JS engine doing so. But what's important to us as JS developers is, in our programs, `myAge` and `yourAge` act as if they have their own copy of that value, rather than sharing it. |

If we later reassign `myAge` to `43` (when I have a birthday), it doesn't affect the `42` that's still assigned to `yourAge`:

```js
myAge++;            // sort of like: myAge = myAge + 1

myAge;              // 43
yourAge;            // 42 <-- unchanged
```
