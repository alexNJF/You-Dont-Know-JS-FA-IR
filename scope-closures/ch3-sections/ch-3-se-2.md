# Shadowing

"Shadowing" might sound mysterious and a little bit sketchy. But don't worry, it's completely legit!

Our running example for these chapters uses different variable names across the scope boundaries. Since they all have unique names, in a way it wouldn't matter if all of them were just stored in one bucket (like RED(1)).

Where having different lexical scope buckets starts to matter more is when you have two or more variables, each in different scopes, with the same lexical names. A single scope cannot have two or more variables with the same name; such multiple references would be assumed as just one variable.

So if you need to maintain two or more variables of the same name, you must use separate (often nested) scopes. And in that case, it's very relevant how the different scope buckets are laid out.

Consider:

```js
var studentName = "Suzy";

function printStudent(studentName) {
    studentName = studentName.toUpperCase();
    console.log(studentName);
}

printStudent("Frank");
// FRANK

printStudent(studentName);
// SUZY

console.log(studentName);
// Suzy
```

| TIP: |
| :--- |
| Before you move on, take some time to analyze this code using the various techniques/metaphors we've covered in the book. In particular, make sure to identify the marble/bubble colors in this snippet. It's good practice! |

The `studentName` variable on line 1 (the `var studentName = ..` statement) creates a RED(1) marble. The same named variable is declared as a BLUE(2) marble on line 3, the parameter in the `printStudent(..)` function definition.

What color marble will `studentName` be in the `studentName = studentName.toUpperCase()` assignment statement and the `console.log(studentName)` statement? All three `studentName` references will be BLUE(2).

With the conceptual notion of the "lookup," we asserted that it starts with the current scope and works its way outward/upward, stopping as soon as a matching variable is found. The BLUE(2) `studentName` is found right away. The RED(1) `studentName` is never even considered.

This is a key aspect of lexical scope behavior, called *shadowing*. The BLUE(2) `studentName` variable (parameter) shadows the RED(1) `studentName`. So, the parameter is shadowing the (shadowed) global variable. Repeat that sentence to yourself a few times to make sure you have the terminology straight!

That's why the re-assignment of `studentName` affects only the inner (parameter) variable: the BLUE(2) `studentName`, not the global RED(1) `studentName`.

When you choose to shadow a variable from an outer scope, one direct impact is that from that scope inward/downward (through any nested scopes) it's now impossible for any marble to be colored as the shadowed variable—(RED(1), in this case). In other words, any `studentName` identifier reference will correspond to that parameter variable, never the global `studentName` variable. It's lexically impossible to reference the global `studentName` anywhere inside of the `printStudent(..)` function (or from any nested scopes).

### Global Unshadowing Trick

Please beware: leveraging the technique I'm about to describe is not very good practice, as it's limited in utility, confusing for readers of your code, and likely to invite bugs to your program. I'm covering it only because you may run across this behavior in existing programs, and understanding what's happening is critical to not getting tripped up.

It *is* possible to access a global variable from a scope where that variable has been shadowed, but not through a typical lexical identifier reference.

In the global scope (RED(1)), `var` declarations and `function` declarations also expose themselves as properties (of the same name as the identifier) on the *global object*—essentially an object representation of the global scope. If you've written JS for a browser environment, you probably recognize the global object as `window`. That's not *entirely* accurate, but it's good enough for our discussion. In the next chapter, we'll explore the global scope/object topic more.

Consider this program, specifically executed as a standalone .js file in a browser environment:

```js
var studentName = "Suzy";

function printStudent(studentName) {
    console.log(studentName);
    console.log(window.studentName);
}

printStudent("Frank");
// "Frank"
// "Suzy"
```

Notice the `window.studentName` reference? This expression is accessing the global variable `studentName` as a property on `window` (which we're pretending for now is synonymous with the global object). That's the only way to access a shadowed variable from inside a scope where the shadowing variable is present.

The `window.studentName` is a mirror of the global `studentName` variable, not a separate snapshot copy. Changes to one are still seen from the other, in either direction. You can think of `window.studentName` as a getter/setter that accesses the actual `studentName` variable. As a matter of fact, you can even *add* a variable to the global scope by creating/setting a property on the global object.

| WARNING: |
| :--- |
| Remember: just because you *can* doesn't mean you *should*. Don't shadow a global variable that you need to access, and conversely, avoid using this trick to access a global variable that you've shadowed. And definitely don't confuse readers of your code by creating global variables as `window` properties instead of with formal declarations! |

This little "trick" only works for accessing a global scope variable (not a shadowed variable from a nested scope), and even then, only one that was declared with `var` or `function`.

Other forms of global scope declarations do not create mirrored global object properties:

```js
var one = 1;
let notOne = 2;
const notTwo = 3;
class notThree {}

console.log(window.one);       // 1
console.log(window.notOne);    // undefined
console.log(window.notTwo);    // undefined
console.log(window.notThree);  // undefined
```

Variables (no matter how they're declared!) that exist in any other scope than the global scope are completely inaccessible from a scope where they've been shadowed:

```js
var special = 42;

function lookingFor(special) {
    // The identifier `special` (parameter) in this
    // scope is shadowed inside keepLooking(), and
    // is thus inaccessible from that scope.

    function keepLooking() {
        var special = 3.141592;
        console.log(special);
        console.log(window.special);
    }

    keepLooking();
}

lookingFor(112358132134);
// 3.141592
// 42
```

The global RED(1) `special` is shadowed by the BLUE(2) `special` (parameter), and the BLUE(2) `special` is itself shadowed by the GREEN(3) `special` inside `keepLooking()`. We can still access the RED(1) `special` using the indirect reference `window.special`. But there's no way for `keepLooking()` to access the BLUE(2) `special` that holds the number `112358132134`.

### Copying Is Not Accessing

I've been asked the following "But what about...?" question dozens of times. Consider:

```js
var special = 42;

function lookingFor(special) {
    var another = {
        special: special
    };

    function keepLooking() {
        var special = 3.141592;
        console.log(special);
        console.log(another.special);  // Ooo, tricky!
        console.log(window.special);
    }

    keepLooking();
}

lookingFor(112358132134);
// 3.141592
// 112358132134
// 42
```

Oh! So does this `another` object technique disprove my claim that the `special` parameter is "completely inaccessible" from inside `keepLooking()`? No, the claim is still correct.

`special: special` is copying the value of the `special` parameter variable into another container (a property of the same name). Of course, if you put a value in another container, shadowing no longer applies (unless `another` was shadowed, too!). But that doesn't mean we're accessing the parameter `special`; it means we're accessing the copy of the value it had at that moment, by way of *another* container (object property). We cannot reassign the BLUE(2) `special` parameter to a different value from inside `keepLooking()`.

Another "But...!?" you may be about to raise: what if I'd used objects or arrays as the values instead of the numbers (`112358132134`, etc.)? Would us having references to objects instead of copies of primitive values "fix" the inaccessibility?

No. Mutating the contents of the object value via a reference copy is **not** the same thing as lexically accessing the variable itself. We still can't reassign the BLUE(2) `special` parameter.

### Illegal Shadowing

Not all combinations of declaration shadowing are allowed. `let` can shadow `var`, but `var` cannot shadow `let`:

```js
function something() {
    var special = "JavaScript";

    {
        let special = 42;   // totally fine shadowing

        // ..
    }
}

function another() {
    // ..

    {
        let special = "JavaScript";

        {
            var special = "JavaScript";
            // ^^^ Syntax Error

            // ..
        }
    }
}
```

Notice in the `another()` function, the inner `var special` declaration is attempting to declare a function-wide `special`, which in and of itself is fine (as shown by the `something()` function).

The syntax error description in this case indicates that `special` has already been defined, but that error message is a little misleading—again, no such error happens in `something()`, as shadowing is generally allowed just fine.

The real reason it's raised as a `SyntaxError` is because the `var` is basically trying to "cross the boundary" of (or hop over) the `let` declaration of the same name, which is not allowed.

That boundary-crossing prohibition effectively stops at each function boundary, so this variant raises no exception:

```js
function another() {
    // ..

    {
        let special = "JavaScript";

        ajax("https://some.url",function callback(){
            // totally fine shadowing
            var special = "JavaScript";

            // ..
        });
    }
}
```

Summary: `let` (in an inner scope) can always shadow an outer scope's `var`. `var` (in an inner scope) can only shadow an outer scope's `let` if there is a function boundary in between.
