# Loose Equals vs. Strict Equals

Loose equals is the `==` operator, and strict equals is the `===` operator. Both operators are used for comparing two values for "equality," but the "loose" vs. "strict" indicates a **very important** difference in behavior between the two, specifically in how they decide "equality."

A very common misconception about these two operators is: "`==` checks values for equality and `===` checks both values and types for equality." While that sounds nice and reasonable, it's inaccurate. Countless well-respected JavaScript books and blogs have said exactly that, but unfortunately they're all *wrong*.

The correct description is: "`==` allows coercion in the equality comparison and `===` disallows coercion."

### Equality Performance

Stop and think about the difference between the first (inaccurate) explanation and this second (accurate) one.

In the first explanation, it seems obvious that `===` is *doing more work* than `==`, because it has to *also* check the type. In the second explanation, `==` is the one *doing more work* because it has to follow through the steps of coercion if the types are different.

Don't fall into the trap, as many have, of thinking this has anything to do with performance, though, as if `==` is going to be slower than `===` in any relevant way. While it's measurable that coercion does take *a little bit* of processing time, it's mere microseconds (yes, that's millionths of a second!).

If you're comparing two values of the same types, `==` and `===` use the identical algorithm, and so other than minor differences in engine implementation, they should do the same work.

If you're comparing two values of different types, the performance isn't the important factor. What you should be asking yourself is: when comparing these two values, do I want coercion or not?

If you want coercion, use `==` loose equality, but if you don't want coercion, use `===` strict equality.

**Note:** The implication here then is that both `==` and `===` check the types of their operands. The difference is in how they respond if the types don't match.

### Abstract Equality

The `==` operator's behavior is defined as "The Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm" in section 11.9.3 of the ES5 spec. What's listed there is a comprehensive but simple algorithm that explicitly states every possible combination of types, and how the coercions (if necessary) should happen for each combination.

**Warning:** When (*implicit*) coercion is maligned as being too complicated and too flawed to be a *useful good part*, it is these rules of "abstract equality" that are being condemned. Generally, they are said to be too complex and too unintuitive for developers to practically learn and use, and that they are prone more to causing bugs in JS programs than to enabling greater code readability. I believe this is a flawed premise -- that you readers are competent developers who write (and read and understand!) algorithms (aka code) all day long. So, what follows is a plain exposition of the "abstract equality" in simple terms. But I implore you to also read the ES5 spec section 11.9.3. I think you'll be surprised at just how reasonable it is.

Basically, the first clause (11.9.3.1) says, if the two values being compared are of the same type, they are simply and naturally compared via Identity as you'd expect. For example, `42` is only equal to `42`, and `"abc"` is only equal to `"abc"`.

Some minor exceptions to normal expectation to be aware of:

* `NaN` is never equal to itself (see Chapter 2)
* `+0` and `-0` are equal to each other (see Chapter 2)

The final provision in clause 11.9.3.1 is for `==` loose equality comparison with `object`s (including `function`s and `array`s). Two such values are only *equal* if they are both references to *the exact same value*. No coercion occurs here.

**Note:** The `===` strict equality comparison is defined identically to 11.9.3.1, including the provision about two `object` values. It's a very little known fact that **`==` and `===` behave identically** in the case where two `object`s are being compared!

The rest of the algorithm in 11.9.3 specifies that if you use `==` loose equality to compare two values of different types, one or both of the values will need to be *implicitly* coerced. This coercion happens so that both values eventually end up as the same type, which can then directly be compared for equality using simple value Identity.

**Note:** The `!=` loose not-equality operation is defined exactly as you'd expect, in that it's literally the `==` operation comparison performed in its entirety, then the negation of the result. The same goes for the `!==` strict not-equality operation.

#### Comparing: `string`s to `number`s

To illustrate `==` coercion, let's first build off the `string` and `number` examples earlier in this chapter:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = "42";

a === b;	// false
a == b;		// true
```

As we'd expect, `a === b` fails, because no coercion is allowed, and indeed the `42` and `"42"` values are different.

However, the second comparison `a == b` uses loose equality, which means that if the types happen to be different, the comparison algorithm will perform *implicit* coercion on one or both values.

But exactly what kind of coercion happens here? Does the `a` value of `42` become a `string`, or does the `b` value of `"42"` become a `number`?

In the ES5 spec, clauses 11.9.3.4-5 say:

> 4. If Type(x) is Number and Type(y) is String,
>    return the result of the comparison x == ToNumber(y).
> 5. If Type(x) is String and Type(y) is Number,
>    return the result of the comparison ToNumber(x) == y.

**Warning:** The spec uses `Number` and `String` as the formal names for the types, while this book prefers `number` and `string` for the primitive types. Do not let the capitalization of `Number` in the spec confuse you for the `Number()` native function. For our purposes, the capitalization of the type name is irrelevant -- they have basically the same meaning.

Clearly, the spec says the `"42"` value is coerced to a `number` for the comparison. The *how* of that coercion has already been covered earlier, specifically with the `ToNumber` abstract operation. In this case, it's quite obvious then that the resulting two `42` values are equal.

#### Comparing: anything to `boolean`

One of the biggest gotchas with the *implicit* coercion of `==` loose equality pops up when you try to compare a value directly to `true` or `false`.

Consider:

```js
var a = "42";
var b = true;

a == b;	// false
```

Wait, what happened here!? We know that `"42"` is a truthy value (see earlier in this chapter). So, how come it's not `==` loose equal to `true`?

The reason is both simple and deceptively tricky. It's so easy to misunderstand, many JS developers never pay close enough attention to fully grasp it.

Let's again quote the spec, clauses 11.9.3.6-7:

> 6. If Type(x) is Boolean,
>    return the result of the comparison ToNumber(x) == y.
> 7. If Type(y) is Boolean,
>    return the result of the comparison x == ToNumber(y).

Let's break that down. First:

```js
var x = true;
var y = "42";

x == y; // false
```

The `Type(x)` is indeed `Boolean`, so it performs `ToNumber(x)`, which coerces `true` to `1`. Now, `1 == "42"` is evaluated. The types are still different, so (essentially recursively) we reconsult the algorithm, which just as above will coerce `"42"` to `42`, and `1 == 42` is clearly `false`.

Reverse it, and we still get the same outcome:

```js
var x = "42";
var y = false;

x == y; // false
```

The `Type(y)` is `Boolean` this time, so `ToNumber(y)` yields `0`. `"42" == 0` recursively becomes `42 == 0`, which is of course `false`.

In other words, **the value `"42"` is neither `== true` nor `== false`.** At first, that statement might seem crazy. How can a value be neither truthy nor falsy?

But that's the problem! You're asking the wrong question, entirely. It's not your fault, really. Your brain is tricking you.

`"42"` is indeed truthy, but `"42" == true` **is not performing a boolean test/coercion** at all, no matter what your brain says. `"42"` *is not* being coerced to a `boolean` (`true`), but instead `true` is being coerced to a `1`, and then `"42"` is being coerced to `42`.

Whether we like it or not, `ToBoolean` is not even involved here, so the truthiness or falsiness of `"42"` is irrelevant to the `==` operation!

What *is* relevant is to understand how the `==` comparison algorithm behaves with all the different type combinations. As it regards a `boolean` value on either side of the `==`, a `boolean` always coerces to a `number` *first*.

If that seems strange to you, you're not alone. I personally would recommend to never, ever, under any circumstances, use `== true` or `== false`. Ever.

But remember, I'm only talking about `==` here. `=== true` and `=== false` wouldn't allow the coercion, so they're safe from this hidden `ToNumber` coercion.

Consider:

```js
var a = "42";

// bad (will fail!):
if (a == true) {
	// ..
}

// also bad (will fail!):
if (a === true) {
	// ..
}

// good enough (works implicitly):
if (a) {
	// ..
}

// better (works explicitly):
if (!!a) {
	// ..
}

// also great (works explicitly):
if (Boolean( a )) {
	// ..
}
```

If you avoid ever using `== true` or `== false` (aka loose equality with `boolean`s) in your code, you'll never have to worry about this truthiness/falsiness mental gotcha.

#### Comparing: `null`s to `undefined`s

Another example of *implicit* coercion can be seen with `==` loose equality between `null` and `undefined` values. Yet again quoting the ES5 spec, clauses 11.9.3.2-3:

> 2. If x is null and y is undefined, return true.
> 3. If x is undefined and y is null, return true.

`null` and `undefined`, when compared with `==` loose equality, equate to (aka coerce to) each other (as well as themselves, obviously), and no other values in the entire language.

What this means is that `null` and `undefined` can be treated as indistinguishable for comparison purposes, if you use the `==` loose equality operator to allow their mutual *implicit* coercion.

```js
var a = null;
var b;

a == b;		// true
a == null;	// true
b == null;	// true

a == false;	// false
b == false;	// false
a == "";	// false
b == "";	// false
a == 0;		// false
b == 0;		// false
```

The coercion between `null` and `undefined` is safe and predictable, and no other values can give false positives in such a check. I recommend using this coercion to allow `null` and `undefined` to be indistinguishable and thus treated as the same value.

For example:

```js
var a = doSomething();

if (a == null) {
	// ..
}
```

The `a == null` check will pass only if `doSomething()` returns either `null` or `undefined`, and will fail with any other value, even other falsy values like `0`, `false`, and `""`.

The *explicit* form of the check, which disallows any such coercion, is (I think) unnecessarily much uglier (and perhaps a tiny bit less performant!):

```js
var a = doSomething();

if (a === undefined || a === null) {
	// ..
}
```

In my opinion, the form `a == null` is yet another example where *implicit* coercion improves code readability, but does so in a reliably safe way.

#### Comparing: `object`s to non-`object`s

If an `object`/`function`/`array` is compared to a simple scalar primitive (`string`, `number`, or `boolean`), the ES5 spec says in clauses 11.9.3.8-9:

> 8. If Type(x) is either String or Number and Type(y) is Object,
>    return the result of the comparison x == ToPrimitive(y).
> 9. If Type(x) is Object and Type(y) is either String or Number,
>    return the result of the comparison ToPrimitive(x) == y.

**Note:** You may notice that these clauses only mention `String` and `Number`, but not `Boolean`. That's because, as quoted earlier, clauses 11.9.3.6-7 take care of coercing any `Boolean` operand presented to a `Number` first.

Consider:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = [ 42 ];

a == b;	// true
```

The `[ 42 ]` value has its `ToPrimitive` abstract operation called (see the "Abstract Value Operations" section earlier), which results in the `"42"` value. From there, it's just `42 == "42"`, which as we've already covered becomes `42 == 42`, so `a` and `b` are found to be coercively equal.

**Tip:** All the quirks of the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation that we discussed earlier in this chapter (`toString()`, `valueOf()`) apply here as you'd expect. This can be quite useful if you have a complex data structure that you want to define a custom `valueOf()` method on, to provide a simple value for equality comparison purposes.

In Chapter 3, we covered "unboxing," where an `object` wrapper around a primitive value (like from `new String("abc")`, for instance) is unwrapped, and the underlying primitive value (`"abc"`) is returned. This behavior is related to the `ToPrimitive` coercion in the `==` algorithm:

```js
var a = "abc";
var b = Object( a );	// same as `new String( a )`

a === b;				// false
a == b;					// true
```

`a == b` is `true` because `b` is coerced (aka "unboxed," unwrapped) via `ToPrimitive` to its underlying `"abc"` simple scalar primitive value, which is the same as the value in `a`.

There are some values where this is not the case, though, because of other overriding rules in the `==` algorithm. Consider:

```js
var a = null;
var b = Object( a );	// same as `Object()`
a == b;					// false

var c = undefined;
var d = Object( c );	// same as `Object()`
c == d;					// false

var e = NaN;
var f = Object( e );	// same as `new Number( e )`
e == f;					// false
```

The `null` and `undefined` values cannot be boxed -- they have no object wrapper equivalent -- so `Object(null)` is just like `Object()` in that both just produce a normal object.

`NaN` can be boxed to its `Number` object wrapper equivalent, but when `==` causes an unboxing, the `NaN == NaN` comparison fails because `NaN` is never equal to itself (see Chapter 2).

### Edge Cases

Now that we've thoroughly examined how the *implicit* coercion of `==` loose equality works (in both sensible and surprising ways), let's try to call out the worst, craziest corner cases so we can see what we need to avoid to not get bitten with coercion bugs.

First, let's examine how modifying the built-in native prototypes can produce crazy results:

#### A Number By Any Other Value Would...

```js
Number.prototype.valueOf = function() {
	return 3;
};

new Number( 2 ) == 3;	// true
```

**Warning:** `2 == 3` would not have fallen into this trap, because neither `2` nor `3` would have invoked the built-in `Number.prototype.valueOf()` method because both are already primitive `number` values and can be compared directly. However, `new Number(2)` must go through the `ToPrimitive` coercion, and thus invoke `valueOf()`.

Evil, huh? Of course it is. No one should ever do such a thing. The fact that you *can* do this is sometimes used as a criticism of coercion and `==`. But that's misdirected frustration. JavaScript is not *bad* because you can do such things, a developer is *bad* **if they do such things**. Don't fall into the "my programming language should protect me from myself" fallacy.

Next, let's consider another tricky example, which takes the evil from the previous example to another level:

```js
if (a == 2 && a == 3) {
	// ..
}
```

You might think this would be impossible, because `a` could never be equal to both `2` and `3` *at the same time*. But "at the same time" is inaccurate, since the first expression `a == 2` happens strictly *before* `a == 3`.

So, what if we make `a.valueOf()` have side effects each time it's called, such that the first time it returns `2` and the second time it's called it returns `3`? Pretty easy:

```js
var i = 2;

Number.prototype.valueOf = function() {
	return i++;
};

var a = new Number( 42 );

if (a == 2 && a == 3) {
	console.log( "Yep, this happened." );
}
```

Again, these are evil tricks. Don't do them. But also don't use them as complaints against coercion. Potential abuses of a mechanism are not sufficient evidence to condemn the mechanism. Just avoid these crazy tricks, and stick only with valid and proper usage of coercion.

#### False-y Comparisons

The most common complaint against *implicit* coercion in `==` comparisons comes from how falsy values behave surprisingly when compared to each other.

To illustrate, let's look at a list of the corner-cases around falsy value comparisons, to see which ones are reasonable and which are troublesome:

```js
"0" == null;			// false
"0" == undefined;		// false
"0" == false;			// true -- UH OH!
"0" == NaN;				// false
"0" == 0;				// true
"0" == "";				// false

false == null;			// false
false == undefined;		// false
false == NaN;			// false
false == 0;				// true -- UH OH!
false == "";			// true -- UH OH!
false == [];			// true -- UH OH!
false == {};			// false

"" == null;				// false
"" == undefined;		// false
"" == NaN;				// false
"" == 0;				// true -- UH OH!
"" == [];				// true -- UH OH!
"" == {};				// false

0 == null;				// false
0 == undefined;			// false
0 == NaN;				// false
0 == [];				// true -- UH OH!
0 == {};				// false
```

In this list of 24 comparisons, 17 of them are quite reasonable and predictable. For example, we know that `""` and `NaN` are not at all equatable values, and indeed they don't coerce to be loose equals, whereas `"0"` and `0` are reasonably equatable and *do* coerce as loose equals.

However, seven of the comparisons are marked with "UH OH!" because as false positives, they are much more likely gotchas that could trip you up. `""` and `0` are definitely distinctly different values, and it's rare you'd want to treat them as equatable, so their mutual coercion is troublesome. Note that there aren't any false negatives here.

#### The Crazy Ones

We don't have to stop there, though. We can keep looking for even more troublesome coercions:

```js
[] == ![];		// true
```

Oooo, that seems at a higher level of crazy, right!? Your brain may likely trick you that you're comparing a truthy to a falsy value, so the `true` result is surprising, as we *know* a value can never be truthy and falsy at the same time!

But that's not what's actually happening. Let's break it down. What do we know about the `!` unary operator? It explicitly coerces to a `boolean` using the `ToBoolean` rules (and it also flips the parity). So before `[] == ![]` is even processed, it's actually already translated to `[] == false`. We already saw that form in our above list (`false == []`), so its surprise result is *not new* to us.

How about other corner cases?

```js
2 == [2];		// true
"" == [null];	// true
```

As we said earlier in our `ToNumber` discussion, the right-hand side `[2]` and `[null]` values will go through a `ToPrimitive` coercion so they can be more readily compared to the simple primitives (`2` and `""`, respectively) on the left-hand side. Since the `valueOf()` for `array` values just returns the `array` itself, coercion falls to stringifying the `array`.

`[2]` will become `"2"`, which then is `ToNumber` coerced to `2` for the right-hand side value in the first comparison. `[null]` just straight becomes `""`.

So, `2 == 2` and `"" == ""` are completely understandable.

If your instinct is to still dislike these results, your frustration is not actually with coercion like you probably think it is. It's actually a complaint against the default `array` values' `ToPrimitive` behavior of coercing to a `string` value. More likely, you'd just wish that `[2].toString()` didn't return `"2"`, or that `[null].toString()` didn't return `""`.

But what exactly *should* these `string` coercions result in? I can't really think of any other appropriate `string` coercion of `[2]` than `"2"`, except perhaps `"[2]"` -- but that could be very strange in other contexts!

You could rightly make the case that since `String(null)` becomes `"null"`, then `String([null])` should also become `"null"`. That's a reasonable assertion. So, that's the real culprit.

*Implicit* coercion itself isn't the evil here. Even an *explicit* coercion of `[null]` to a `string` results in `""`. What's at odds is whether it's sensible at all for `array` values to stringify to the equivalent of their contents, and exactly how that happens. So, direct your frustration at the rules for `String( [..] )`, because that's where the craziness stems from. Perhaps there should be no stringification coercion of `array`s at all? But that would have lots of other downsides in other parts of the language.

Another famously cited gotcha:

```js
0 == "\n";		// true
```

As we discussed earlier with empty `""`, `"\n"` (or `" "` or any other whitespace combination) is coerced via `ToNumber`, and the result is `0`. What other `number` value would you expect whitespace to coerce to? Does it bother you that *explicit* `Number(" ")` yields `0`?

Really the only other reasonable `number` value that empty strings or whitespace strings could coerce to is the `NaN`. But would that *really* be better? The comparison `" " == NaN` would of course fail, but it's unclear that we'd have really *fixed* any of the underlying concerns.

The chances that a real-world JS program fails because `0 == "\n"` are awfully rare, and such corner cases are easy to avoid.

Type conversions **always** have corner cases, in any language -- nothing specific to coercion. The issues here are about second-guessing a certain set of corner cases (and perhaps rightly so!?), but that's not a salient argument against the overall coercion mechanism.

Bottom line: almost any crazy coercion between *normal values* that you're likely to run into (aside from intentionally tricky `valueOf()` or `toString()` hacks as earlier) will boil down to the short seven-item list of gotcha coercions we've identified above.

To contrast against these 24 likely suspects for coercion gotchas, consider another list like this:

```js
42 == "43";							// false
"foo" == 42;						// false
"true" == true;						// false

42 == "42";							// true
"foo" == [ "foo" ];					// true
```

In these nonfalsy, noncorner cases (and there are literally an infinite number of comparisons we could put on this list), the coercion results are totally safe, reasonable, and explainable.

#### Sanity Check

OK, we've definitely found some crazy stuff when we've looked deeply into *implicit* coercion. No wonder that most developers claim coercion is evil and should be avoided, right!?

But let's take a step back and do a sanity check.

By way of magnitude comparison, we have *a list* of seven troublesome gotcha coercions, but we have *another list* of (at least 17, but actually infinite) coercions that are totally sane and explainable.

If you're looking for a textbook example of "throwing the baby out with the bathwater," this is it: discarding the entirety of coercion (the infinitely large list of safe and useful behaviors) because of a list of literally just seven gotchas.

The more prudent reaction would be to ask, "how can I use the countless *good parts* of coercion, but avoid the few *bad parts*?"

Let's look again at the *bad* list:

```js
"0" == false;			// true -- UH OH!
false == 0;				// true -- UH OH!
false == "";			// true -- UH OH!
false == [];			// true -- UH OH!
"" == 0;				// true -- UH OH!
"" == [];				// true -- UH OH!
0 == [];				// true -- UH OH!
```

Four of the seven items on this list involve `== false` comparison, which we said earlier you should **always, always** avoid. That's a pretty easy rule to remember.

Now the list is down to three.

```js
"" == 0;				// true -- UH OH!
"" == [];				// true -- UH OH!
0 == [];				// true -- UH OH!
```

Are these reasonable coercions you'd do in a normal JavaScript program? Under what conditions would they really happen?

I don't think it's terribly likely that you'd literally use `== []` in a `boolean` test in your program, at least not if you know what you're doing. You'd probably instead be doing `== ""` or `== 0`, like:

```js
function doSomething(a) {
	if (a == "") {
		// ..
	}
}
```

You'd have an oops if you accidentally called `doSomething(0)` or `doSomething([])`. Another scenario:

```js
function doSomething(a,b) {
	if (a == b) {
		// ..
	}
}
```

Again, this could break if you did something like `doSomething("",0)` or `doSomething([],"")`.

So, while the situations *can* exist where these coercions will bite you, and you'll want to be careful around them, they're probably not super common on the whole of your code base.

#### Safely Using Implicit Coercion

The most important advice I can give you: examine your program and reason about what values can show up on either side of an `==` comparison. To effectively avoid issues with such comparisons, here's some heuristic rules to follow:

1. If either side of the comparison can have `true` or `false` values, don't ever, EVER use `==`.
2. If either side of the comparison can have `[]`, `""`, or `0` values, seriously consider not using `==`.

In these scenarios, it's almost certainly better to use `===` instead of `==`, to avoid unwanted coercion. Follow those two simple rules and pretty much all the coercion gotchas that could reasonably hurt you will effectively be avoided.

**Being more explicit/verbose in these cases will save you from a lot of headaches.**

The question of `==` vs. `===` is really appropriately framed as: should you allow coercion for a comparison or not?

There's lots of cases where such coercion can be helpful, allowing you to more tersely express some comparison logic (like with `null` and `undefined`, for example).

In the overall scheme of things, there's relatively few cases where *implicit* coercion is truly dangerous. But in those places, for safety sake, definitely use `===`.

**Tip:** Another place where coercion is guaranteed *not* to bite you is with the `typeof` operator. `typeof` is always going to return you one of seven strings (see Chapter 1), and none of them are the empty `""` string. As such, there's no case where checking the type of some value is going to run afoul of *implicit* coercion. `typeof x == "function"` is 100% as safe and reliable as `typeof x === "function"`. Literally, the spec says the algorithm will be identical in this situation. So, don't just blindly use `===` everywhere simply because that's what your code tools tell you to do, or (worst of all) because you've been told in some book to **not think about it**. You own the quality of your code.

Is *implicit* coercion evil and dangerous? In a few cases, yes, but overwhelmingly, no.

Be a responsible and mature developer. Learn how to use the power of coercion (both *explicit* and *implicit*) effectively and safely. And teach those around you to do the same.

Here's a handy table made by Alex Dorey (@dorey on GitHub) to visualize a variety of comparisons:
